# BizcardX
This project is a Streamlit application that allows users to upload an image of a business card and extract relevant information from it using easyOCR.
The extracted information includes the company name, card holder name, designation, mobile number, email address, website URL, area, city, state, and pin
code. The extracted information is then displayed in the application's graphical user interface (GUI).This application also allows users to save the extracted information into a database along with the uploaded business card image. The database is able to store multiple entries, each with its own business card image and extracted information. It also allows the user to edit the details of the card.

Overall, the result of the project is that it is a useful tool for businesses and individuals who need to manage business card information efficiently.
